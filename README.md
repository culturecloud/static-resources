# static-resources
Just a repository to store some of my static resources to get them with CDN.
## What is this?
The idea is to use [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/?docs=gh) content delivery network to get any static file stored in this repository (I know it's not the best idea but it works)
## How does this work?
* [Get any public repository as a CDN directory](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/culturecloud/static-resources/)
